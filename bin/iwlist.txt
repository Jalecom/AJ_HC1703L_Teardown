NAME
       iwlist - display detailed wireless interface information

SYNOPSIS
       iwlist interface [scanning | frequency | rate | power | retry | auth | keys | modulation]

DESCRIPTION
       iwlist is a diagnostic tool used to display detailed wireless information
       for IEEE 802.11 interfaces using Linux Wireless Extensions (WEXT).

       This build of iwlist is part of the HC1703 IP camera firmware and is derived
       from the open-source Wireless Tools package by Jean Tourrilhes.

       The code is based on iwlist.c from wireless-tools version 29 (circa 2009),
       with minor backports from version 30, and has been modified for embedded use.

ORIGIN
       This iwlist implementation is derived from:

           Wireless Tools for Linux
           Copyright (c) 1997–2011 Jean Tourrilhes <jt@hpl.hp.com>

       Specifically from:
           wireless-tools v29, file iwlist.c

       The following upstream functions are present in this build:

           print_scanning_info()
           print_scanning_token()
           print_freq_info()
           print_bitrate_info()
           print_txpower_info()
           print_modul_info()
           print_auth_info()
           print_key_info()
           print_pm_info()
           print_retry_info()
           print_event_capa()

       Command-line help, banner strings, and GPL copyright notices
       have been removed in this firmware version.

COMMANDS
       scanning
              Perform a scan and list detected access points.

       frequency
              Display available channels and frequencies.

       rate
              Show supported bitrates.

       power
              Display power management capabilities.

       retry
              Show retry limits and lifetime.

       auth
              Show authentication and WPA capabilities.

       keys
              Display encryption key status.

       modulation
              Show supported modulation schemes.

IMPLEMENTATION
       This program uses Linux Wireless Extensions ioctls including:

           SIOCGIWSCAN
           SIOCGIWRATE
           SIOCGIWFREQ
           SIOCGIWPOWER
           SIOCGIWRETRY
           SIOCGIWENCODE
           SIOCGIWAUTH

       Output formatting and data parsing follow the upstream Wireless Tools design.
