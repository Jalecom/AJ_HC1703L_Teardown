NAME
       ptztest - PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) control and test utility

SYNOPSIS
       ptztest
       ptztest <command>

DESCRIPTION
       ptztest is a command-line utility used to control and test a PTZ
       (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) device through the character device /dev/ptz.

       The utility communicates directly with a proprietary PTZ kernel
       driver using ioctl() system calls. It is intended for factory
       testing, debugging, calibration, and low-level control of PTZ
       camera mechanisms.

       When executed without arguments, ptztest runs in interactive mode
       and presents a control menu. When a single argument is provided,
       the corresponding PTZ command is executed once and the program exits.

DEVICE
       /dev/ptz
              Character device providing access to the PTZ motor driver.

MODES OF OPERATION
       Interactive mode:
              ptztest

              Displays a menu and waits for user input from stdin.

       One-shot mode:
              ptztest <command>

              Executes a single PTZ command specified by the first character
              of <command>.

COMMANDS
       0      Stop all PTZ movement.

       1      Move left (pan left).

       2      Move right (pan right).

       3      Move up (tilt up).

       4      Move down (tilt down).

       5      Move up-left.

       6      Move up-right.

       7      Move down-left.

       8      Move down-right.

       9      Zoom in.

       a      Zoom out.

       b      Set preset position (PSP).
              The user is prompted for a preset number.

       c      Delete preset position (PSP).
              The user is prompted for a preset number.

       d      Call preset position (PSP).
              The user is prompted for a preset number.

       e      Start cruise mode.
              The user is prompted for a route number.

       f      Start auto-scan mode.

       g      Set pan and tilt speed.
              The user is prompted to enter x-speed and y-speed.

       h      Perform relative movement.
              Moves the camera by a relative offset based on the mechanical
              range and current position.

       p      Show current PTZ position.

       r      Reset PTZ device.

       t      Toggle PTZ driver debug output on or off.

       y      Set PPS (pulse/precision parameter).
              The user is prompted for a new PPS value.

       ?      Display the command menu.

       q      Exit the program (interactive mode only).

SPEED CONTROL
       The pan (x-speed) and tilt (y-speed) values are global parameters
       used by movement commands. Default values are:

              x-speed = 32
              y-speed = 32

       Speed values are passed directly to the PTZ driver and are not
       range-checked by ptztest.

EXAMPLES
       Start interactive PTZ control:
              ptztest

       Move camera left:
              ptztest 1

       Zoom in:
              ptztest 9

       Reset PTZ mechanism:
              ptztest r

NOTES
       - Root privileges are usually required to access /dev/ptz.
       - No safety checks are performed on movement limits.
       - Improper usage may cause mechanical stress or damage.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
       ptztest provides unrestricted low-level control of the PTZ hardware.
       If exposed to untrusted users, it may allow:
       - unauthorized camera movement
       - forced mechanical wear
       - bypass of operational restrictions
       - enabling of kernel driver debug output

       Access to this utility should be restricted in production systems.
