FEATURES
       • Multiple requests in single command line
       • Connection keep-alive for performance
       • Automatic retry on transient failures
       • Chunked transfer encoding support
       • Basic authentication support (embedded in URL)
       • Custom headers and multipart uploads
       • Timeout control via environment variable

URL FORMAT
       http://[user:password@]host[:port][/path]
       ws://[user:password@]host[:port][/path]
       
       Examples:
         http://example.com
         http://user:pass@example.com:8080/api/endpoint
         http://192.168.1.100:8000/download

NOTES
       • The program can execute multiple commands in sequence by
         chaining them on the command line
       
       • HTTP response body is printed to stdout for 'get' and 'post'
         commands (when status is 200 OK)
       
       • Response headers and status code are printed in debug format
         like: [STATUS_CODE]
       
       • For 'get2' command, output is saved to ./ota.bin by default
       
       • Authentication credentials in URL are automatically Base64
         encoded for HTTP Basic Auth
       
       • The utility supports WebSocket URLs (ws://) but limited to
         HTTP-style requests

EXAMPLES
       Simple GET request:
         httpclt get http://api.example.com/status

       Download file with custom timeout:
         export timeout=30000
         httpclt getfile http://example.com/large.zip output.zip

       POST form data:
         httpclt post http://example.com/login "user=admin&pass=secret"

       Upload multiple files with form data:
         httpclt multi http://example.com/upload \
           title="My Upload" \
           description="Test files" \
           file1=@/tmp/doc.pdf \
           file2=#/tmp/image.png

       Multiple operations in sequence:
         httpclt get http://example.com/first \
                 post http://example.com/second "data=value" \
                 getfile http://example.com/third output.txt

       With authentication:
         httpclt get http://user:password@example.com/api/private

LIMITATIONS
       • No HTTPS/SSL support
       • Limited HTTP header customization
       • No cookie handling
       • No redirect following
       • Maximum URL length: 64 characters for hostname
       • Maximum request buffer: 2048 bytes
