NAME
       hostapd v2.6-devel
	   User space daemon for IEEE 802.11 AP management,
	   IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP/RADIUS Authenticator
	   Access Point and WPA/WPA2 authenticator for HC1703 cameras

SYNOPSIS
       hostapd [-B] [-d] [-t] [-K] [-f logfile] config_file
	   
	   hostapd [-hdBKtv] [-P <PID file>] [-e <entropy file>] \
         [-g <global ctrl_iface>] [-G <group>] \
         <configuration file(s)>

DESCRIPTION
       hostapd  is  a  user-space  daemon  that implements IEEE 802.11 Access Point (AP)
       functionality together with WPA/WPA2, RSN and IEEE 802.1X authentication.

       This build of hostapd is used in HC1703-based IP cameras to create the temporary
       Wi-Fi access point used for device setup and, in some cases, for local networking.

       The daemon uses the Linux nl80211 / cfg80211 interface to communicate with the
       wireless driver and implements a complete WPA2 authentication state machine.

FEATURES
       This build supports:

           - IEEE 802.11 AP mode
           - WPA and WPA2 (RSN)
           - WPA-PSK (pre-shared key)
           - WPA-Enterprise (802.1X with RADIUS)
           - TKIP and CCMP (AES) encryption
           - nl80211 driver interface

       The following upstream features are NOT present in this build:

           - WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)
           - Wi-Fi Direct (P2P)
           - Mesh (802.11s)
           - DFS / radar detection
           - Automatic channel selection

OPTIONS
	   -h     Show usage
	   
	   -d     Show more debug messages (-dd for even more)

       -B     Run in background (daemon mode). Causes hostapd to fork after initialization.
	   
	   -e     Entropy file
	   
	   -g     Global control interface path

       -G     Group for control interfaces
	   
	   -P     PID file
	   
       -K     Include key data in debug messages
	   
       -S     Start all the interfaces synchronously
	   
       -t     Include timestamps in some debug messages

       -v      Display version information on the terminal and exit.

       -K     Do not clear old EAPOL state on startup.

       -f logfile
              Write log output to the specified file instead of stderr.

CONFIGURATION
       hostapd is configured using a text configuration file.

       Common options:

           interface=wlan0
           bridge=br0
           driver=nl80211
           ssid=IPCAM_1234
           hw_mode=g
           channel=6

       Open (unencrypted) access point:

           auth_algs=1
           wpa=0

       WPA2-PSK:

           wpa=2
           wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
           wpa_passphrase=12345678
           rsn_pairwise=CCMP

       WPA-Enterprise (802.1X):

           wpa=2
           wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
           ieee8021x=1
           auth_server_addr=192.168.1.10
           auth_server_port=1812
           auth_server_shared_secret=secret

       Supported encryption ciphers:

           wpa_pairwise=TKIP CCMP
           rsn_pairwise=CCMP

OPERATION IN HC1703 CAMERAS
       In HC1703-based cameras, hostapd is used to create the temporary Wi-Fi access
       point that a smartphone connects to during device setup.

       The typical sequence is:

           1. hostapd starts and creates an SSID (e.g. IPCAM_xxxx)
           2. The phone connects to this access point
           3. The phone sends the home Wi-Fi credentials
           4. hostapd is stopped
           5. The camera switches to station (client) mode using wpa_supplicant

       Some firmwares keep hostapd running permanently to provide a local AP.

DRIVER INTERFACE
       This build uses the Linux nl80211/cfg80211 interface to communicate with the Wi-Fi
       driver via netlink sockets.

       This allows hostapd to:

           - Create and remove AP interfaces
           - Set SSID, channel and security
           - Receive client connect/disconnect events
           - Exchange encryption keys with the driver

FILES
       /etc/hostapd.conf
              Default configuration file.

       /tmp/hostapd.conf
              Often generated dynamically by camera firmware.
