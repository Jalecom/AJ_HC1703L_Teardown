NAME
       gio - direct GPIO control utility using /dev/gio

SYNOPSIS
       gio -g <gpio>
       gio -s <gpio> <value>
       gio -do <gpio> <value>
       gio -di <gpio>

DESCRIPTION
       gio is a command-line utility used to directly control GPIO
       (General Purpose Input/Output) pins through the character device
       /dev/gio.

       The utility communicates with a proprietary kernel driver using
       ioctl() system calls. It does not rely on sysfs, libgpiod, or
       standard Linux GPIO frameworks.

       gio is typically intended for hardware debugging, factory testing,
       or low-level device control in embedded systems.

OPTIONS
       -g <gpio>
              Read the current value of the specified GPIO.

              The GPIO must already be configured as input or output.
              The returned value is either 0 or 1.

       -s <gpio> <value>
              Set the value of the specified GPIO.

              <value> must be 0 or 1.
              The GPIO must be configured as output.

       -do <gpio> <value>
              Configure the specified GPIO as output and set its value.

              <value> must be 0 or 1.

       -di <gpio>
              Configure the specified GPIO as input.

EXAMPLES
       Configure GPIO 12 as output and set it high:
              gio -do 12 1

       Set GPIO 12 to low:
              gio -s 12 0

       Configure GPIO 7 as input:
              gio -di 7

       Read GPIO 7 value:
              gio -g 7

NOTES
       - Access to /dev/gio is required.
       - The command typically must be executed as root.
       - No validation is performed on GPIO numbers.
       - Improper usage may cause hardware malfunction.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
       gio provides unrestricted low-level access to GPIO hardware.
       Uncontrolled usage may allow:
       - watchdog disable
       - forced reboot
       - power rail manipulation
       - sensor or peripheral interference

       Access to this utility should be restricted in production systems.

FILES

              driver.
