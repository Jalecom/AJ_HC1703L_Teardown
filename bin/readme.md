# Augentix SoC – `/bin` Executables

This directory contains a selection of executable binaries found in the
`/bin` directory of an Augentix-based SoC.

These programs appear to be internal utilities and diagnostic tools provided
by the vendor. At the time of writing, **no official documentation is
available** for any of them.

The manual pages included alongside these binaries are **unofficial** and
**best-effort** reconstructions. They are based on static analysis, limited
runtime testing, and general reverse-engineering of the executables.

The purpose of this collection is to:
- record observed behaviour and command interfaces,
- provide a starting point for further analysis,
- and make otherwise opaque system tools slightly more approachable.

All information should be considered **preliminary** and **subject to change**.
Nothing here should be assumed to be complete or authoritative.

Use with due caution.
