#		 removing the SD card and rebooting the device restores the camera to its previous settings.
#
#	T  = Temporary => The hack gets copied to RAM (e.g. /tmp/hack) and runs from there;
#		 removing the SD card and rebooting the device restores the camera to its previous settings.
#
#	P  = Permanent => a mini version of the hack is copied to /bak, on each reboot it’s copied to RAM and run from there;
#		 sensor.sh is permanently modifyed to run minihack.sh, if present; 
#		 it stay persistently even after pushing the factory reset button;
#		 due to space availability in the /bak folder:
#		 - a mini version of busybox is used
#		 - telnetd is used instead dropbear ssh
#		 - the start.sh check before for debug_cmd.sh and then run sensor.sh wich run the hack
#		 - after the installation, the SD card is not requested anymore.
#
#	NO = No hack => /home/minihack.sh is removed ( /bak/hack folder stays) and the script exit
#
#	Default = SD
